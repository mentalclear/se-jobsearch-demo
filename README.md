# Selenium Automation demo project


### Idea: Collect websites of companies that are currently hiring Quality Engineers  

This automation works with `Indeed`. Searches for `Quality Engineer` in the United States and then just collects names and homepages for companies who post job ads into a CSV file that can be imported into Google Sheets/Excel.

Indeed doesn't allow their job search API to be used, so this is the only way, looks like...

It's not perfect in any sense but it works.
